# ChatRooms
This was an iOS application built with Objective-C that was project for a class in college. The idea was to create an app that
would allow users to create different ChatRooms, give them a name and then have users be able to join the chat and participate.
Full functionality was there. Unfortunately, this app made user of Parse and their API's which was discontinued by Facebook so
this app is no longer functional.
